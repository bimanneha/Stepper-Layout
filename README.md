# Stepper-Layout
Stepper-Layout


=> Used the Angular Material Library and created a Stepper component with 4 steps.

a) Address
b) Payment
c) Review
d) Done

=> Dynamically updating the Mat-Icons based on whether the previous form has been filled or not.

a) If the 1st step is not filled, when user clicks on Next button, the 1st step will show a numerical value.
(The stepper will show a 'number' instead of the icon)

b) However, if the user completes the form on the 1st step, and then clicks on Next button, the 1st step will be marked as 'done'. (The stepper will show a 'check' / 'tick' as the icon)

=> Also, Integrated the Adyen Credit Card Payment component in the Payment step of the Stepper.
